# Laravel Bug Courier

## Introduction

`laravel-bug-courier` is a Laravel package designed to facilitate bug reporting and issue tracking across multiple platforms. It provides a structured way to capture, store, and report bugs using various integrations such as email, Azure DevOps, GitHub, and Trello. The package allows you to configure reporting methods and use predefined services, domain entities, and repositories either independently or in combination.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
composer require manuelluvuvamo/laravel-bug-courier
```

After installing, publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Providers\BugCourierServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `config/bug-courier.php` file where you can customize the package settings.

## Usage

### Reporting Bugs Automatically

If `BUG_COURIER_AUTOMATIC=true`, the package will automatically capture and report application errors. Otherwise, you can manually report bugs using the `CreateItemService` service.

### Manually Reporting Bugs

To manually create a bug report:

```php
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Application\Services\Item\CreateItemService;
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Application\Services\Item\CreateItemDto;

$service = app(CreateItemService::class);
$data = new CreateItemDto(
    'Bug Title',
    'Bug Description',
    ['key' => 'value'],
    'open'
);
$service->execute($data);
```

### Using Services

The package provides the following services:

- `CreateItemService` - Handles bug creation and reporting.

### Using Domain Entities

The package includes domain entities to represent bug reports:

- `Item` - Represents a bug in the system.
- `CreateItemDto` - Data transfer object for creating a bug report.

### Using Infrastructure Repositories

The package provides repositories to interact with various bug tracking systems:

- `ItemAzureDevopsRepository` - Reports bugs to Azure DevOps.
- `ItemGithubRepository` - Reports bugs to GitHub.
- `ItemTrelloRepository` - Reports bugs to Trello.

You can use a specific repository directly if needed:

```php
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Infra\Item\ItemGithubRepository;

$repository = app(ItemGithubRepository::class);
$repository->save($data);
```

---

## Example Workflows

### Reporting a Bug via GitHub

```php
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Application\Services\Item\CreateItemService;
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Application\Services\Item\CreateItemDto;

$data = new CreateItemDto('Bug in checkout process', 'Description of the issue', ['module' => 'checkout'], 'open');
$service = app(CreateItemService::class);
$service->execute($data);
```

### Reporting a Bug via Email

Ensure that `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` and the recipient email is set in `.env`.

```php
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Application\Services\Item\CreateItemService;
use ManuelLuvuvamo\BugCourier\Application\Services\Item\CreateItemDto;

$data = new CreateItemDto('Database connection error', 'Timeout issue', ['server' => 'db01'], 'open');
$service = app(CreateItemService::class);
$service->execute($data);
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Enabling Only Specific Reporting Methods

You can only use one reporting method at a time. Enable the desired method in `.env` and disable the others. For example, to use only GitHub:

```ini
GITHUB_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_ENABLED=false
AZURE_DEVOPS_ENABLED=false
TRELLO_ENABLED=false
```

### Queueing Email Reports for Performance

The `laravel-bug-courier` package allows sending error reports via email either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the `.env` configuration.

To define the desired behavior, set the following variable:
```ini
BUG_COURIER_EMAIL_QUEUE=true # true for async sending, false for immediate sending
```

If `BUG_COURIER_EMAIL_QUEUE=true`, the package will send emails using Laravel's queue system. Make sure your application is properly configured for queues in `config/queue.php` and that a worker is running:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

If `BUG_COURIER_EMAIL_QUEUE=false`, emails will be sent immediately without using queues.

**Note:** There is no need to modify the `CreateItemService`. The package is already prepared to work with both options.

## Conclusion

`laravel-bug-courier` provides a structured and flexible way to manage and report bugs in Laravel applications. With support for multiple platforms and easy customization, it can fit into various workflows. Configure the package as needed, use the provided services, domain entities, and repositories, and start tracking bugs efficiently.
